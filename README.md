- after comparing, give them a special name i.e "Indie Hacker, Reply Guy, etc"
- while streaming the heatmap calendar, pop in their most commits in a day or biggest tweet
- after comparing, show people with similar ratios
- have a leaderboard, sorted from most to least commit ratios
- for holidays, callout tweeting, coding, or living
